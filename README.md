## How is the program structured?
The program is executed on a monthly retainer basis. After our initial assessment and planning phases, we provide you with a custom digital marketing plan to reach your business goals, and then we build your foundation.

### Assessment
First, we conduct a series of audits across your outbound efforts and your current digital marketing activities (SEO, content, email, social, PPC, automation) to identify opportunities. After we’ve gathered the data, we evaluate the competition’s digital marketing landscape to discover your business’ competitive edge.

### Planning
Building upon this insight, we create a customized plan based on your company, your competition, your industry, and your goals. The initial strategic plan we provide outlines the tactics to be implemented over the following 12 months.

### Building your foundation
Next, we build and upgrade your digital marketing foundation. From website to social media, email to CMS; if it’s broken, inadequate, or non-existent, we fix and optimize it. Whether that means a new website, curating an email list, or SEO implementation, it all needs to be right to maximize your ROI.

Can you build a house without a foundation? Sure. Can it withstand storms and support your family’s growth? No. And the same goes for your company’s digital marketing strategy.

A lot of marketing frameworks dive right into creating traffic and generating leads. But that’s like building walls and installing doors before you take the time to lay a proper foundation for your house.

Foundations do more than just provide a base. They insulate, fight moisture, and prevent shifting and settling from the earth. Well-made foundations should last forever. A strong digital marketing foundation is no different. It generates brand awareness, drives traffic, and guides leads through your funnel to the decision-making stage. And, it sets your business up for a lifetime of success.

In order to achieve exponential growth, your strategy must be holistic. Each element of digital marketing dovetails. For example, if you’re writing a blog, that single article could have a ton of SEO value to improve your ranking; inspire an awesome email marketing campaign; become an optimal place to drive your paid ads; and present an ideal opportunity to house premium content that nudges prospective buyers toward the decision-making stage of their journey.

Imagine if none of these digital marketing pieces worked in tandem? It would be so unproductive (and expensive) for your business to navigate. When you’re aware of the connectivity and constantly leveraging each channel efficiently, you’re utilizing a solid digital marketing foundation. And that solid foundation ensures that you can create the right baseline metrics, measure those outcomes, and hit your goals. Again, and again. That’s where we come in.

Without a solid digital marketing foundation, your business won’t withstand economic crises or grow as effectively. Not to mention, why spend money on paid advertising if there’s no place to send the traffic or no strategy to nurture the leads once they’ve arrived?
